        <p>Hi there space cowboy! Logically one would introduce themselves with a title or a tag that usually goes with such templates. However, I would like to start with a quote from Arthur Rimbaud that could perfectly describe me:</p>
        <blockquote>
            A thousand Dreams within me softly burn.

            <i>~ Arthur Rimbaud</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As for the rest, a delightful cup of tea might add the flavor of further introduction. I hear on this space station there is a perfect spot for making new friends. What do you think? Should we have a chat?  </p>
